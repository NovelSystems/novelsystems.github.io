    <h2>How We Work</h2>
    <div class="approach-grid">
      <div>
        <p>Novel Systems Engineering operates as a small, focused consultancy. That means direct engagement with an experienced engineer — not account management layers and junior staff. When you bring us a problem, the person who answers is the person doing the work.</p>
        <p>We specialize in the hard part: first-of-a-kind technology, regulated environments, and the messy space between prototype and production. Our background spans semiconductor device physics, thermal imaging systems, utility-scale energy storage, and hardware authentication infrastructure — a range that reflects a deliberate approach to building transferable engineering judgment rather than narrow specialization.</p>
        <p>Engagements are scoped to deliver specific, measurable outcomes. We don't bill hours for status meetings.</p>
