A dual orthogonal 1D silicon photonic phased array achieves 128x phase shifter reduction, transforming manufacturing yield from 10–30% to 93–98% and bringing sensor costs from $50,000–200,000 down to $600–800. Two provisional patents filed; SBIR Phase I submitted to U.S. Coast Guard.</description></item><item><title>The Birthmark Standard — Hardware-Backed Photo Authentication</title><link>https://novelsystems.me/portfolio/birthmark-standard-photo-authentication/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://novelsystems.me/portfolio/birthmark-standard-photo-authentication/</guid><description>Founded a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and designed the complete technical architecture for a privacy-preserving photo authentication system — from camera sensor fingerprinting through blockchain registration — establishing the Birthmark Media Registry as background infrastructure for validating whether images seen online actually originated from a camera.</description></item></channel></rss>
