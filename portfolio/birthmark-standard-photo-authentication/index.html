AI-generated images are now visually indistinguishable from photographs, and no widely deployed system can reliably prove that a given image came from a real camera at a specific time. The consequences extend well beyond technology — public trust in photojournalism, documentary evidence, and visual reporting is eroding in ways that directly affect democratic institutions.</p><p>The dominant industry response — the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) — embeds cryptographic signatures in image metadata. This approach has a fundamental distribution problem: social media platforms strip metadata during reprocessing, and by some estimates 95% of real-world image sharing loses authentication data entirely. A system that only works when images are never shared is not a system that works.</p><p>The Birthmark Standard was designed from first principles to solve this: authenticate images in a way that survives the actual distribution channels people use. The full technical architecture is described in the <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04933>whitepaper</a>.</p><h2 id=founding-the-birthmark-standard-foundation>Founding The Birthmark Standard Foundation</h2><p>Recognizing that photo authentication infrastructure needed to be operated as a public good — not a commercial product controlled by any single company — Novel Systems Engineering established The Birthmark Standard Foundation as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. The Foundation develops and maintains the open-source standard, operates the Birthmark Media Registry, and governs the coalition of institutional validators that run the blockchain network.</p><p>The nonprofit structure was a deliberate architectural decision, not a fundraising strategy. Authentication infrastructure that depends on a corporation&rsquo;s continued interest or profitability is authentication infrastructure that can be abandoned or monetized against the interests of its users. Photojournalists, archives, and the public need to trust that the system will operate independently and indefinitely. A foundation governed by its mission — not its shareholders — is the only structure that credibly provides that guarantee.</p><p>Samuel C. Ryan serves as Founder and Executive Director. All technical design, development, and implementation has been performed directly by Novel Systems Engineering.</p><h2 id=the-birthmark-media-registry>The Birthmark Media Registry</h2><p>The Birthmark Media Registry is the core infrastructure product: a background system designed to validate whether images seen online actually originated from a camera. It operates as a public utility — always available, invisible to end users, and independent of any single platform or manufacturer.</p><p>The registry is built on a custom Substrate blockchain operated by institutional validators: universities, archives, journalism organizations, and other institutions with a structural interest in media integrity. When a camera captures an image, the system authenticates the device through its manufacturer, hashes the image, and stores a compact authentication record on-chain. Anyone — a journalist, a fact-checker, a platform, or an individual — can later verify whether a given image exists in the registry, confirming it was captured by authenticated hardware at a recorded time.</p><p>This works regardless of format conversion, metadata stripping, social media reprocessing, or any other transformation the image undergoes after capture. The registry stores authentication independently of the image file itself — the property that makes it fundamentally different from C2PA and similar metadata-dependent approaches.</p><p>At scale, the registry is designed to be operationally sustainable. Each authentication record uses approximately 140 bytes of on-chain storage. At one million images per day, that translates to 55 GB per year of growth, with query latency under 50 milliseconds. Institutional validators can operate a full node for $200–350 per year — a cost structure that makes long-term participation viable for journalism schools, public libraries, and nonprofit archives, not just well-funded technology companies.</p><h2 id=technical-architecture>Technical Architecture</h2><p><img src=/images/portfolio/Full_Visual_Pipeline.png alt="Birthmark Standard authentication pipeline — from camera capture through blockchain registration"></p><p>The system exploits a physical property of image sensors: manufacturing-unique non-uniformity correction (NUC) maps and photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU) patterns. Every sensor has a distinct fingerprint that cannot be forged or transferred. This fingerprint becomes the hardware root of trust.</p><h3 id=capture-and-authentication>Capture and Authentication</h3><p>At capture, the camera computes a SHA-256 hash of the raw image data, encrypts a device fingerprint token using rotating keys from assigned key tables, and submits an authentication bundle to a Manufacturer Authority server. The Manufacturer Authority validates the encrypted token — confirming the image came from a real device — without ever seeing the image content or being able to track individual cameras. The full image hash is then stored on the Birthmark Media Registry.</p><h3 id=privacy-architecture>Privacy Architecture</h3><p>The key table architecture is the critical privacy mechanism. Cameras are assigned to anonymity sets exceeding 1,000 devices, with rotating keys that prevent the Manufacturer Authority from correlating authentication requests to individual cameras. Manufacturers confirm that images come from real cameras without knowing which camera or what was photographed. This is a hard requirement, not a nice-to-have — photographers working in sensitive environments need assurance that authentication cannot become surveillance.</p><h3 id=blockchain-design>Blockchain Design</h3><p>The Birthmark Media Registry uses a custom Substrate-based blockchain with Byzantine fault tolerance, targeting 20 institutional validator nodes with a minimum of 3 required for continued operation. Full SHA-256 image hashes are stored directly on-chain, eliminating the need for complex cryptographic proofs. There are no gas fees or transaction costs — institutional validators donate hosting as a public good, consistent with the Foundation&rsquo;s nonprofit mission.</p><p>Record size optimization was a significant engineering focus. The initial record format required 450 bytes per authentication entry. Through systematic analysis of field requirements and encoding, this was reduced to approximately 140 bytes — a 69% reduction that directly determines whether small institutions can afford to participate as validators over the long term.</p><h3 id=verification>Verification</h3><p>Verification is a hash lookup. Anyone can check whether a given image hash exists on-chain, confirming it was captured by authenticated hardware at a recorded time. No special software is required beyond the ability to compute a SHA-256 hash and query the registry. This simplicity is intentional — verification that requires specialized tools or platform cooperation will not achieve the adoption necessary to be useful.</p><h2 id=proxy-manufacturer--developer-authority-services>Proxy Manufacturer & Developer Authority Services</h2><p>Camera manufacturers and software developers integrating with the Birthmark Standard are required to operate a Manufacturer Authority (MA) or Developer Authority (DA) server as a condition of participation. This is specialized cryptographic infrastructure — key ceremony management, certificate issuance, token validation, and ongoing compliance with the standard&rsquo;s technical requirements. Most camera manufacturers and software developers do not have this capability in-house, and building it from scratch is a poor use of their engineering resources.</p><p>Novel Systems Engineering provides proxy MA/DA services for organizations that need this capability without building and maintaining it themselves. Services include authentication server operation, key table management, certificate issuance, and compliance with Birthmark Standard technical requirements. Manufacturers gain full participation in the authenticated media ecosystem — verified hardware roots of trust, blockchain registration, and coalition validator recognition — without the overhead of running their own authority infrastructure.</p><p>This service is designed for camera manufacturers, OEMs, and software developers who want to integrate quickly and cleanly.</p><h2 id=development-status>Development Status</h2><p><strong>Phase 1 (Complete):</strong> Functional hardware prototype on Raspberry Pi 4 HQ Camera, operational submission server with manufacturer validation, deployed Substrate blockchain registry, and validated end-to-end authentication pipeline. The core architecture has been <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04933>peer-reviewed and published</a>.</p><p><strong>Phase 2 (In Progress):</strong> Android camera application development with user testing across 50–100 participants. This phase transitions the system from hardware prototype to a form factor that enables broader testing and feedback.</p><p><strong>Long-term Target:</strong> Operational infrastructure for the 2028 U.S. Presidential Election — providing photojournalists, news organizations, and the public with a tool to verify that images from the campaign trail originated from real cameras.</p><h2 id=what-this-demonstrates>What This Demonstrates</h2><p>The Birthmark Standard represents the full range of what Novel Systems Engineering does: identifying a systemic problem, designing a technical architecture to address it, building the implementation across hardware and software boundaries, and establishing the organizational structure to sustain it. The work spans sensor-level physics, embedded firmware, cryptographic protocol design, blockchain infrastructure, and nonprofit governance — disciplines that rarely coexist in a single engineering effort.</p><p>The proxy MA/DA service extends the Foundation&rsquo;s mission into an ongoing operational capability, making it practical for manufacturers to participate in the authenticated media ecosystem without duplicating specialized infrastructure.</p></div></div><div class=section style="border-top:1px solid var(--color-rule);padding-top:2rem"><div class=container><a href=/portfolio/ style=color:var(--color-ink-mid);font-size:.9rem>&larr; Back to Portfolio</a></div></div></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=container><div class=footer-grid><div class=footer-about><img src=/images/novel_systems_banner2.png alt="Novel Systems Engineering" class=footer-logo><h4>Novel Systems Engineering</h4><p>Systems engineering consulting across hardware, software, and emerging technology.</p></div><div class=footer-nav><h4>Quick Links</h4><ul class=footer-links><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=/about/>About</a></li><li><a href=/services/>Services</a></li><li><a href=/portfolio/>Portfolio</a></li><li><a href=/contact/>Contact</a></li></ul></div></div><div class=footer-ornament>— ✦ —</div><div class=footer-bottom><p>&copy; 2026 Novel Systems Engineering, LLC.
