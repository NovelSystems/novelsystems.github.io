A dual orthogonal 1D silicon photonic phased array achieves 128x phase shifter reduction, transforming physical defect yield from 74% to 98.5% and bringing sensor costs from $50,000–200,000 down to $600–800. Two provisional patents filed covering the core DDR architecture, adaptive environmental calibration, shared-aperture autonomous target acquisition, and distributed perimeter sensor networks; SBIR Phase I submitted to U.S. Coast Guard.</description></item></channel></rss>
