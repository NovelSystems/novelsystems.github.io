Systems engineering is the discipline that owns the interfaces — the places where firmware meets sensors, where test equipment meets the device under test, where data acquisition meets production decisions. Most engineering failures happen at these boundaries, and they&rsquo;re hardest to manage when the system has never been built before. That&rsquo;s where we work.</p><h3 id=what-this-means-in-practice>What This Means in Practice</h3><ul><li>Defining and validating interfaces between hardware and software subsystems</li><li>Test system architecture — designing the equipment, firmware, and software that prove a product works, including systems with no commercial precedent</li><li>Sensor integration and data acquisition across mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical domains</li><li>Validation methodology development for first-of-a-kind systems where no industry standard test exists</li><li>Production readiness — building the infrastructure that turns a working prototype into a manufacturable product</li><li>Requirements decomposition from system-level specifications down to component acceptance criteria</li></ul><h3 id=relevant-experience>Relevant Experience</h3><ul><li>Designed and commissioned 6 test systems integrating mechanical fixtures, sensor arrays, data acquisition, and automated pass/fail software for utility-scale energy storage; all systems remain operational 5+ years post-deployment</li><li>Led $1.5M test infrastructure investment for energy storage manufacturer — hardware procurement, software development, and facility integration delivered on schedule and within budget</li><li>Architected complete hardware authentication pipeline from camera sensor through embedded firmware, cryptographic signing, and blockchain verification</li></ul><hr><h2 id=hardware-engineering>Hardware Engineering</h2><p>The physical side of the systems we build. Design, analysis, and validation of mechanical and electromechanical systems — always with an eye toward how they&rsquo;ll be tested, instrumented, and integrated with their software counterparts.</p><h3 id=capabilities>Capabilities</h3><ul><li>Test stand and fixture design for novel and first-of-a-kind systems</li><li>AS9102 First Article Inspection and DOD/MIL compliance</li><li>Mechanical systems analysis and failure investigation</li><li>Thermal reliability testing and environmental qualification</li><li>Production fixture and tooling design</li><li>Optical and photonic system architecture</li></ul><h3 id=relevant-experience-1>Relevant Experience</h3><ul><li>Rebuilt AS9102 First Article Inspection program under active DOD audit conditions at defense manufacturer</li><li>Designed thermal and environmental qualification test systems for energy storage products with 3,000–6,000 components per assembly</li><li>Developed dual orthogonal 1D phased array architecture for material-discriminating LiDAR, reducing phase shifter count 128× and improving manufacturing yield from 10–30% to 93–98%</li></ul><hr><h2 id=software--embedded-systems>Software & Embedded Systems</h2><p>The firmware, automation, and data systems that make hardware useful. We write software that talks to real things — sensors, actuators, instruments, production lines — not web apps.</p><h3 id=capabilities-1>Capabilities</h3><ul><li>Embedded firmware architecture and hardware-software interface development</li><li>Test automation and instrument control (LabVIEW, Python, custom)</li><li>Data acquisition system design and signal processing</li><li>Database development and analytical tooling (SQL, Python, VBA)</li><li>Hardware authentication and cryptographic system design</li><li>Production quality tracking and automated reporting</li></ul><h3 id=relevant-experience-2>Relevant Experience</h3><ul><li>Automated quality tracking for assemblies with 3,500–6,000 components, reducing 30-minute manual processes to single-click operations</li><li>Developed MTBF tracking and analytical tooling across complex multi-component products</li><li>Designed FMCW coherent detection and signal processing architecture for polarization-based material discrimination</li></ul><hr><h2 id=consulting--advisory>Consulting & Advisory</h2><p>Technical consulting for organizations navigating novel technology development, regulatory requirements, or the transition from R&amp;D to production. Independent assessment without the overhead of large consulting firms.</p><h3 id=what-this-looks-like>What This Looks Like</h3><ul><li><strong>R&amp;D to Production Transition:</strong> Bridging the gap between prototype and manufacturable product. Process validation, test coverage analysis, and production readiness assessment.</li><li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Quality system development and audit preparation for aerospace (AS9100, DOD/MIL), defense, and other regulated environments.</li><li><strong>Technical Due Diligence:</strong> Independent engineering assessment of systems, architectures, and claims. Useful for investment decisions, acquisition review, or internal escalations requiring a neutral technical voice.</li><li><strong>Patent Development:</strong> Technical writing and claim development for patent applications across hardware, software, and systems domains.</li><li><strong>Process Improvement:</strong> Systematic analysis and restructuring of engineering and quality processes. Focus on eliminating waste without sacrificing rigor.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=engagement-model>Engagement Model</h2><p>Engagements are scoped to deliver specific, measurable outcomes. We work directly with the technical and business stakeholders who own the problem — not through account managers or project coordinators.</p><p>Typical engagements run 4–16 weeks with defined deliverables. Longer retainer arrangements are available for organizations that need sustained technical support across multiple workstreams.</p><p>All work is performed by Samuel C. Ryan directly. Novel Systems Engineering does not subcontract.</p></div></div><div class="section cta-band"><div class=container style=text-align:center><h2>Have a project in mind?</h2><p>Engagements start with a conversation.
