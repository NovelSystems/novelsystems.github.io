Process validation, test coverage analysis, and production readiness assessment.</li><li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Quality system development and audit preparation for aerospace (AS9100, DOD/MIL), defense, and other regulated environments.</li><li><strong>Technical Due Diligence:</strong> Independent engineering assessment of systems, architectures, and claims. Useful for investment decisions, acquisition review, or internal escalations requiring a neutral technical voice.</li><li><strong>Patent Development:</strong> Technical writing and claim development for patent applications across hardware, software, and systems domains. Experience across mobile firmware, imaging systems, data management, and sensor technology.</li><li><strong>Process Improvement:</strong> Systematic analysis and restructuring of engineering and quality processes. Focus on eliminating waste without sacrificing rigor.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=engagement-model>Engagement Model</h2><p>Engagements are scoped to deliver specific, measurable outcomes. We work directly with the technical and business stakeholders who own the problem — not through account managers or project coordinators.</p><p>Typical engagements run 4–16 weeks with defined deliverables. Longer retainer arrangements are available for organizations that need sustained technical support across multiple workstreams.</p><p>All work is performed by Samuel C. Ryan directly. Novel Systems Engineering does not subcontract.</p></div></div><div class="section cta-band"><div class=container style=text-align:center><h2>Have a project in mind?</h2><p>Engagements start with a conversation.
