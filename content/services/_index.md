## Systems Engineering & Integration

The core of what we do: taking hardware and software subsystems and making them work together as a complete, validated product — especially when there's no existing playbook. Systems engineering is the discipline that owns the interfaces — the places where firmware meets sensors, where test equipment meets the device under test, where data acquisition meets production decisions. Most engineering failures happen at these boundaries, and they're hardest to manage when the system has never been built before. That's where we work.

### What This Means in Practice
- Defining and validating interfaces between hardware and software subsystems
- Test system architecture — designing the equipment, firmware, and software that prove a product works, including systems with no commercial precedent
- Sensor integration and data acquisition across mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical domains
- Validation methodology development for first-of-a-kind systems where no industry standard test exists
- Production readiness — building the infrastructure that turns a working prototype into a manufacturable product
- Requirements decomposition from system-level specifications down to component acceptance criteria

### Relevant Experience
- Designed and commissioned 6 test systems integrating mechanical fixtures, sensor arrays, data acquisition, and automated pass/fail software for utility-scale energy storage; all systems remain operational 5+ years post-deployment
- Led $1.5M test infrastructure investment for energy storage manufacturer — hardware procurement, software development, and facility integration delivered on schedule and within budget
- Architected complete hardware authentication pipeline from camera sensor through embedded firmware, cryptographic signing, and blockchain verification

## Hardware Engineering

The physical side of the systems we build. Design, analysis, and validation of mechanical and electromechanical systems — always with an eye toward how they'll be tested, instrumented, and integrated with their software counterparts.

### Capabilities
- Test stand and fixture design for novel and first-of-a-kind systems
- AS9102 First Article Inspection and DOD/MIL compliance
- Mechanical systems analysis and failure investigation
- Thermal reliability testing and environmental qualification
- Production fixture and tooling design
- Optical and photonic system architecture

### Relevant Experience
- Rebuilt AS9102 First Article Inspection program under active DOD audit conditions at defense manufacturer
- Designed thermal and environmental qualification test systems for energy storage products with 3,000–6,000 components per assembly
- Developed dual orthogonal 1D phased array architecture for material-discriminating LiDAR, reducing phase shifter count 128× and improving manufacturing yield from 10–30% to 93–98%

## Software & Embedded Systems

The firmware, automation, and data systems that make hardware useful. We write software that talks to real things — sensors, actuators, instruments, production lines — not web apps.

### Capabilities
- Embedded firmware architecture and hardware-software interface development
- Test automation and instrument control (LabVIEW, Python, custom)
- Data acquisition system design and signal processing
- Database development and analytical tooling (SQL, Python, VBA)
- Hardware authentication and cryptographic system design
- Production quality tracking and automated reporting

### Relevant Experience
- Automated quality tracking for assemblies with 3,500–6,000 components, reducing 30-minute manual processes to single-click operations
- Developed MTBF tracking and analytical tooling across complex multi-component products
- Designed FMCW coherent detection and signal processing architecture for polarization-based material discrimination

## Consulting & Advisory

Technical consulting for organizations navigating novel technology development, regulatory requirements, or the transition from R&D to production. Independent assessment without the overhead of large consulting firms.

### What This Looks Like
- **R&D to Production Transition:** Bridging the gap between prototype and manufacturable product. Process validation, test coverage analysis, and production readiness assessment.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Quality system development and audit preparation for aerospace (AS9100, DOD/MIL), defense, and other regulated environments.
- **Technical Due Diligence:** Independent engineering assessment of systems, architectures, and claims. Useful for investment decisions, acquisition review, or internal escalations requiring a neutral technical voice.
- **Patent Development:** Technical writing and claim development for patent applications across hardware, software, and systems domains.
- **Process Improvement:** Systematic analysis and restructuring of engineering and quality processes. Focus on eliminating waste without sacrificing rigor.

## Engagement Model

Engagements are scoped to deliver specific, measurable outcomes. We work directly with the technical and business stakeholders who own the problem — not through account managers or project coordinators.

Typical engagements run 4–16 weeks with defined deliverables. Longer retainer arrangements are available for organizations that need sustained technical support across multiple workstreams.

All work is performed by Samuel C. Ryan directly. Novel Systems Engineering does not subcontract.
