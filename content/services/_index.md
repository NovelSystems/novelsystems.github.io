## Systems & Mechanical Engineering

Design, analysis, and validation of complex hardware systems — from individual components through full production infrastructure. Particular depth in test system architecture, first article inspection, and the difficult work of establishing validation methodologies for technology without commercial precedent.

### Capabilities
- Test stand design and commissioning for novel and first-of-a-kind systems
- AS9102 First Article Inspection and DOD/MIL compliance
- Mechanical systems analysis and failure investigation
- Thermal reliability testing and environmental qualification
- Production infrastructure design and scale-up
- Cross-functional coordination across engineering, operations, and quality

### Relevant Experience
- Designed and commissioned 6 test systems for utility-scale energy storage technology; all systems remain operational 5+ years post-deployment
- Led $1.5M test infrastructure investment for energy storage manufacturer on schedule and within budget
- Rebuilt AS9102 First Article Inspection program under active DOD audit conditions at defense manufacturer

## Software & Embedded Systems

Embedded software development, test automation, and data systems engineering. Experience spans hardware-software interfaces, sensor integration, production-scale validation tooling, and cryptographic system design.

### Capabilities
- Test automation and data acquisition system development
- Embedded firmware architecture and integration
- Hardware authentication and cryptographic system design
- Database development and analytical tooling (SQL, VBA, Python)
- LabVIEW instrumentation and measurement systems
- Production quality tracking and automated reporting systems

### Relevant Experience
- Automated quality tracking for assemblies with 3,500–6,000 components, reducing 30-minute manual processes to button-click operations
- Architected complete hardware authentication pipeline from camera sensor through blockchain verification
- Developed analytical tooling for MTBF tracking across products with 3,000–6,000 components

## Consulting & Advisory

Technical consulting for organizations navigating novel technology development, regulatory requirements, or the transition from R&D to production. Independent assessment without the overhead of large consulting firms.

### What This Looks Like
- **R&D to Production Transition:** Bridging the gap between prototype and manufacturable product. Process validation, test coverage analysis, and production readiness assessment.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Quality system development and audit preparation for aerospace (AS9100, DOD/MIL), defense, and other regulated environments.
- **Technical Due Diligence:** Independent engineering assessment of systems, architectures, and claims. Useful for investment decisions, acquisition review, or internal escalations requiring a neutral technical voice.
- **Patent Development:** Technical writing and claim development for patent applications across hardware, software, and systems domains. Experience across mobile firmware, imaging systems, data management, and sensor technology.
- **Process Improvement:** Systematic analysis and restructuring of engineering and quality processes. Focus on eliminating waste without sacrificing rigor.

## Engagement Model

Engagements are scoped to deliver specific, measurable outcomes. We work directly with the technical and business stakeholders who own the problem — not through account managers or project coordinators.

Typical engagements run 4–16 weeks with defined deliverables. Longer retainer arrangements are available for organizations that need sustained technical support across multiple workstreams.

All work is performed by Samuel C. Ryan directly. Novel Systems Engineering does not subcontract.
