Novel Systems Engineering takes on a small number of engagements at a time to ensure direct, focused attention on each project. If you have a technically demanding problem — particularly one that sits at the edge of what's been done before — reach out.

### What to Include

A brief description of the problem is enough to start. No formal RFP or detailed specification required — an initial conversation is typically more efficient than a written brief for scoping whether there's a good fit.

If you have a sense of timeline or budget constraints, including those upfront saves a step. If you don't, that's fine too.

### What Happens Next

Initial consultations are at no charge. If the engagement looks like a good fit, we'll agree on scope, timeline, and fee before any work begins. All engagements are governed by a written agreement.
