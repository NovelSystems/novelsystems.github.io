I'm a systems engineer with 15+ years building production-scale infrastructure across regulated industries. My work spans the full technical stack — from semiconductor device physics and hardware design through software integration, test automation, and validation.

My career has taken me from optoelectronic test engineering at the component level through thermal imaging camera manufacturing at FLIR Systems, utility-scale flow battery test infrastructure at ESS Inc., and independent research in photonic sensing systems and hardware authentication. That range isn't coincidence — I've deliberately sought technically demanding problems in domains where engineering judgment has to be built from first principles rather than borrowed from precedent.

I founded Novel Systems Engineering to offer that kind of engagement to organizations working on hard problems. If you're building something novel — genuinely novel, not just new to your team — and you need an engineer who has done the uncomfortable work of figuring things out without a roadmap, that's what I do.

Prior to consulting, I spent five years at ESS Inc. designing and commissioning test infrastructure for first-of-a-kind utility-scale energy storage technology, managed quality and compliance programs at FLIR Systems supporting DOD aerospace contracts, and developed patent applications across mobile firmware, imaging systems, and data management for an intellectual property law firm. I hold an M.Sc. in Semiconductor Process Engineering and a B.Sc. in Chemistry from the University of Oregon, and served as a satellite communications technician in the Oregon Air National Guard.
